        <h2>What is Economics?</h2>
        <p>According to common sense, economics is simply what goes on in our mind while making choices on what to buy, where to spend, choosing one thing over another - be it choosing to sleep over doing your homework or choosing VertX instead of any other platform. Therefore, economics is the study of choices and these choices arise due to scarcity (i.e, we have unlimited wants and limited resources). In a utopian world, if there were unlimited resources - thus no scarcity - economics wouldnâ€™t exist. 

            In technical terms, economics is a social science that studies how individuals, businesses, governments and societies allocate scarce resources to satisfy their needs through the production, distribution, consumption of goods and services
            </p>

    <div class="div1">
        <h2>What is Economic Demand?</h2>
        <p>Basically, demand refers to a consumer's willingness to buy any product or service over a period of time. Consumers must also have the ability to pay for something they want or need as determined by their disposable income budget. Therefore, demand is a force that affects economic growth and market expansion. </p>
        <p>The demand varies according various factors, some of them are - </p>
        <b>1)	Cost of a good or service.</b>
        <p>If the cost of a good goes up, the demand goes down and vice-versa.</p>
        <b>2)	Income of buyers</b>
        <p>The increase in income leads to an increase in purchasing power of an individual leading to an increase in demand and vice-versa. </p>
        <b>3)	Tastes or preferences</b>
        <p> If consumer preference is in favor of a certain product, the quantity demanded increases and vice-versa</p>
    </div>
    <div class="div1">
        <h2>What is the Law of Demand?</h2>
        <p>It is a qualitative statement which depicts an inverse relationship between the prices of goods and services and their quantity demanded, i.e, at higher prices, the consumers will demand lower quantities of a good and vice-versa 
            </p>

            <h3>A Real life scenario </h3>
            <p>The demand for VertXâ€™s AI enabled stock trading package boosted due to the fall in the prices of its packages for social welfare</p>

    <div class="div1">
        <h2>What is Economic Supply</h2>
        <p>In simple words, Supply is an economic concept that describes the total amount of a specific good or service that is available to consumers. It is the willingness of the producer to sell goods and services in the market at specific prices at a point of time. all else being equal, the supply provided by producers will rise if the price rises because all firms look to maximize profits

            <img src="image2.png" alt="">
           <p> The supply varies according various factors, some of them are - A</p>
            <b>4)	Cost of a raw materials and inputs</b>
           <p> If the cost of a good goes up, the supply goes down and vice-versa.</p>
            <b>5)	Consumer Demand</b>
            <p>As more customers demand a good, firms will focus on increasing the supply of that good. </p>
            <b>6)	Technological Innovation</b>
            <p>Firms that have invested more in technology and innovation will likely have greater production capabilities.It directly relates to how many goods a company can  manufacture and supply to the market at a point of time.</p>
            <b>7)	Government Policy </b>
            <p>Some policies may disincentivize production that makes companies not want to supply markets with specific goods. Alternatively, companies may receive tax incentives or subsidies to increase production. In either case, the government directly influences the quantity of product released to the market.</p>

    <div class="div1">
        <h2>What is the Law of Supply? </h2>
        <p>The law of supply is an economic theory which predicts how the price of goods and services affects their supply. In technical terms, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity of goods or services increases and vice versa.
